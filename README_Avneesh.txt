# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

To analyze Kickstarter data for Theatres based on their launch date and goals, and creating a visual to depict the success, failure and cancellations


### Purpose

The purpose was to gain experience with excel and learn how to use it to analyze, manipulate and present various formats of data.

## Analysis and Challenges

The analysis was for theatres, and their outcomes that were based on launch date and goals


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

* Percentage successful has a steady increase, and then sharp increase followed by a decline
* Percentage of failed maintains a constant trend
* The percentage of successful goals were higher than that of failure and cancellations


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

* Percentage successful has a steady decline, and then sharp increase followed by a decline
* Percentage of failed has a steady increase, and then a sharp decline, followed by an increase again

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
* Challenges that could have been encountered were that of the CountIf formula properly being executed
* If the formulas went wrong then the risk of visualizations being compromised 


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

The conclusion I was able to draw was that the percentage of success for the Outcomes based on launch date were higher than the cancellations and failures until December where the failure and success percentage was the same



- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The data seemed a little more volatile here where failure and success went back and forth where for lower ranges the percentage of success was higher, and then eventually ended up with failure being higher at the higher ranges


- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The dataset for goals seemed to churn out a different graph than the based on start date. This lack of consistency casts some doubt over the data’s accuracy 


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could create a pie chart to highlight the percentage of success, failure, cancellations. We could also create a stacked bar chart
